#Info

Took an audio file and used Fourier transform to take it into the frequency domain and removed some portion of noise
Used Inverse Fourier Transforms to receive the voice signal back


6000.wav- input sound file
OUTPUT1.wav- inverse fourier transformed signal voice
OUTPUT2.wav- sound file in time domain for 0.8Bw bandwidth
OUTPUT3.wav- sound file in time domain for 0 phase response in fourier domain
